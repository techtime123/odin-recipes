    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat butter and olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper strips, onion strips, and garlic and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add Italian sausage, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Stir to combine, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove sausage links and cut on the diagonal into coin slices. Return sausage slices to the skillet. Season with basil, garlic granules, and crused red pepper flakes. Stir to combine. Mix in heavy cream and reserved pasta water. Cover and cook sauce for 8 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide cooked rotini amongst plates and serve topped with sauce.</li>
